# Bike Store Sales Analysis

This project explores a comprehensive dataset of bike store sales, spanning multiple years, countries, and product categories. Using Pythonâ€™s **pandas** for data manipulation and **matplotlib** for visualization, the goal is to extract insights about customer demographics, sales trends, and product performance.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains sales records with the following key fields:

* **Date, Day, Month, Year:** Time-related details for each sale.
* **Customer\_Age, Age\_Group, Customer\_Gender:** Customer demographic information.
* **Country, State:** Geographic details of the sale.
* **Product\_Category, Sub\_Category, Product:** Details about the product sold.
* **Order\_Quantity, Unit\_Cost, Unit\_Price, Profit, Cost, Revenue:** Financial and quantity metrics.

## Key Questions Explored

* What is the average age of customers and their distribution?
* How does order quantity vary and what are typical order sizes?
* Which years and months had the highest sales volume?
* What countries contribute most to sales and revenue?
* What are the best-selling products and categories?
* Are there noticeable relationships between costs, prices, profits, and quantities?
* How do profits and customer ages vary by country?
* How have sales evolved over time?
* What is the impact of tax adjustments on unit prices in different countries?

## Summary of Findings
